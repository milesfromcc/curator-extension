NPM INSTRUCTIONS:

1. npm run build

2. npm run start

ADDING THE EXTENSION TO YOUR BROWSER:

1. open a new tab and go to chrome://extensions/

2. click 'Load unpacked' and select the build directory from within your repo

3. if you make changes and they aren't automatically applied you can click the reload icon

NEED TO KNOW:

- there are always going to be errors while in development mode so don't worry too much if those don't go away

- you can try cloning from this commit if you want to deal with less errors: https://github.com/milesfromcc/curator-extension/commit/b3372460fd0ac1ca3368f7409b783d4c0dec3dd2

- or potentially this earlier one which is even earlier: https://github.com/milesfromcc/curator-extension/commit/e26701a74e733bc61e611231b20bda8e831f01f5

good luck and lemme know what i can do to help!
