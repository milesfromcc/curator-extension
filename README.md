## Installation

### Set it up and get it running locally

1. `npm install`

2. `npm run build`

3. `npm run start`

### Add the extension to your browser:

1. Open a new tab and go to `chrome://extensions/`.

2. At the top of the screen, enable developer mode.

3. Click `Load unpacked` and select the `/build` directory (which is only created after you've executed `npm run start`) from the local repo.

## Things to know

- If you make changes and they aren't automatically applied, you can click the reload icon (?)

---

- there are always going to be errors while in development mode so don't worry too much if those don't go away

- you can try cloning from this commit if you want to deal with less errors: https://github.com/milesfromcc/curator-extension/commit/b3372460fd0ac1ca3368f7409b783d4c0dec3dd2

- or potentially this earlier one which is even earlier: https://github.com/milesfromcc/curator-extension/commit/e26701a74e733bc61e611231b20bda8e831f01f5

good luck and lemme know what i can do to help!
